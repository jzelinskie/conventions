# Conventions

Learning the syntax and semantics of a language is only the first step for new
developer. The second step is learning about the language ecosystem.

Conventions is an example Go package that is loaded with documentation
specifically targeting new developers that have done the Go Tour and have
read the documentation on the "go" binary, but want to know more about writing
packages and software.
